Hi! My name is Ramon and I am a Computer Science major at Brooklyn College. I love playing video games and basketball, and I've recently found a hobby in tackling difficult coding problems. My 2 current goals are 1) to work in the game design field and be apart of the development of something culturally significant, and 2) to help my parents become financially secure in their retirement. My dream vacation would be on a luxury cruise where I could visit many of the world's countries.
