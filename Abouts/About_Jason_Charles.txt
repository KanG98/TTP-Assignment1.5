My name is Jason A. Charles, I dream about becoming a software engineer while being able to travel the world and integrate my profession with it. 
Some of my hobbies consist of me playing the trumpet, playing basketball, working out, playing video games, coding, reading, and watching some of my favorite shows like Mr.Robot. 
I am very passionate about code for some reason. 
I first learned how to code in my senior year of high school when I took an AP cs principles class and we learned how to code in java script, but pretty simple stuff it was all in the program scratch which basically like a building block or legos but for code. 
It was pretty exciting and it opened up a whole new world for me. My dream vacation is to go to Canada and see the Northern lights.
